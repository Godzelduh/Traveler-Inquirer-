## Description 

This is a tool that helps the user plan a travel spot that they want to go on.
Regardless of it being business or pleasure, the use of this tool makes it convenient.
The user can input their scehdule, finances and the size of the party with their ages.
The application will then generate a travel location for the user based on their answers.
The user can then inquire where they would like to take this trip, or continue to input more.

## User Story

AS A travel inquirer, 
<br>
I WANT to know what is the most affordable vacation in my schedule 
<br>
SO THAT I know if I am able to afford going with my family or by myself.
<br>
I ALSO WANT to log my data so that the application knows how to find an accurate result, 
<br>
SO THAT I don't need to be concerned with setting up the intial criteria.
<br>

## Acceptance Criteria 

PROVIDED a convenient application, 
<br>
WHEN I load the app, 
<br>
THEN I have the main page loaded to input my height and weight
<br>
WHEN I submit my data,
<br>
THEN I receive the results of my BMI.
<br>
WHEN I navigate to the 'Results' page,
<br>
THEN I see the daily logs of all my entries.
<br>
WHEN I try to enter a new log twice on the same day, 
<br>
THEN the page does not log it in multiple times.
<br>
WHEN I want to learn fun facts, and the relevance of of BMI today, 
<br>
THEN I tap on to the 'Relevance' tab to read about everything I want to know. 
<br>
WHEN I want to go back to the 'home' or 'results' page,
<br>
THEN I tap on any tab on the navigational bar.
<br>

## Installation 

The installation process is quick and easy since everything is already set up for the user. The user will only need to input the URL into the search bar, that will then take them right onto the home page of 'What is My BMI?'. Once they've gotten into the website, they may navigate anywhere they would like by clicking the navigational buttons on the top of the page, as well as logging their BMI in the modal. 

## Usage 

This is a quick and easy to use application by simply picking the feet and inches of the user by navigating through a drop down menu. 
For the weight portion, we ask the users to just type in what their weight is, and immediately after this, they will see the results of their BMI.
They can also refer to the 'Results' page to see a daily log of any changes they've had on their BMI, which is recommending for any user trying to make this part of a new lifestyle.
